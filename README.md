# Piggy Bank [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jaeeee/Piggy-Bank.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jaeeee/Piggy-Bank)

The software project is a web based implementation of a budgeting app. It will allow users to view their spending habits while giving suggestions on how to better spend and budget their hard earned money. Our focus is to streamline the budgeting and saving process as much as possible, from the minimalistic UI to the easy budgeting calculator.

## **App Architecture**

Web-based application using React and Firebase.

## **Data Model**

User accounts will be stored in a database attached to their information such as money in accounts and the different spending categories.

## **Testing** 

All commits that are pushed to the master branch are tested using Travis CI. The image next to the Piggy Bank header on this README file displays the current state of the build, it will tell you whether or not the build is passing or not.
